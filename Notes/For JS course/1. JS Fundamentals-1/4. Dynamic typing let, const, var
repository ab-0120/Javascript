DYNAMIC TYPING IN JS - Js allows changing one type of variable to another

let an = 23;
console.log(typeof an);

an = 'anshita';
console.log(typeof an);


DIFFERENT WAYS OF DECLARING A VARIABLE

1. let keyword-- can change its value || mutable

let aw = 123;

2. const keyword- used to define immutable value that will never change|| cannot declare a variable without assigning any value

const as = 12;
as++;       // error assignment to const variable

const amx; //error

console.log(as);

3. var keyword -- same as let but used in older versions , more of functional oriented

var abzzzz = 23;

It is prefreable to use let keyword
