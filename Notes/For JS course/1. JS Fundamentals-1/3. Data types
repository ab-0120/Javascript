 DATA TYPES IN JS

Only two types OBJECT AND PRIMITIVE---------------------


1. Primitive ----- 7 primitives

a) Numbers- JS has only numbers. It includes decimal as well as integers

let a = 23;
let b = 0.888888888;
let c = 21.12;

console.log(a);
console.log(b);
console.log(c);

b) strings - Can use either single or double quotes with strings

let fname = "Anshita";
let lname = 'Bisht';

console.log(fname, lname);

c) boolean - logical one that can either be true or false

let bool = false;
let yes = true;

console.log(yes, bool);

d) Undefined - a variable that is declared but not defined with any value

let children;

console.log(children); // undefined

e) NULL - means empty value

let abc = null;
console.log(abc);      //null

f) Symbol(ES2015)- value that is unique and cannot be changed

g) BigInt(ES2020)- can hold bigger interger values than numbers


//////////***************************************************** */

JS is a dynamic language that is it automatically detect the type of values.
In JS values has a type and not variables................

typeof --- to determine the data type of a value or variable

console.log(typeof abc)                     //object-- bug because it should be null
console.log(typeof bool)                    //boolean
console.log(typeof fname)                   //string
console.log(typeof a)                       //number
console.log(typeof children)                //undefined
